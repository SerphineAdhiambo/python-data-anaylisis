🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis
📌 Project Title
Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📄 Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset using the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries in Python. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.


🔍 Features & Analysis
Loading and exploring data

Checking for missing values and cleaning data

Summary statistics using .describe()

Grouping by species and calculating means

Visualizations:

Line chart (petal length trends)

Bar chart (average petal length per species)

Histogram (distribution of sepal width)

Scatter plot (sepal vs petal length)


📌 Findings
Iris-setosa has distinctly shorter petals.

Clear separation among species in petal dimensions.

Strong correlation between petal length and petal width.
